# log_regression
Implementation of l2-regularized logistic regression classifier algorithm with example.

Either using your own dataset or the built-in example dataset, this module follows certain steps to get final prediction while also plotting and calculating misclassification error. The code is by no means is flawless despite best effort. Hence, any feedback and contribution is welcomed.

How-to generate prediction:
1. Create 1-on-1 classifier by loading either your own training dataset or bird images example training dataset
2. Run main function using your own test dataset or bird test labels example dataset. Run will save and return prediction
3. ???
4. Profit!
